Additional code from MRC for post processing of features has been uploaded.

This code is not under active development. Other versions include:
- (https://github.com/JimHokanson/SegwormMatlabClasses) - a partial reimplementation of the code that uses Matlab classes for better encapsulation
- (https://github.com/MichaelCurrie/movement_validation) - part of this repo is similar to the Matlab classes except the code is in Python
